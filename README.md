# Location-Allocation

Location is often considered the most important factor leading to the success of a private- or public-sector organization. Private-sector organizations can profit from a good location, whether a small coffee shop with a local clientele or a multinational network of factories with distribution centers and a worldwide chain of retail outlets. Location can help keep fixed and overhead costs low and accessibility high. Public-sector facilities, such as schools, hospitals, libraries, fire stations, and emergency response services (ERS) centers, can provide high-quality service to the community at a low cost when a good location is chosen.

Problem:
Find the hotels which have the most restaurants in their vicinity. Calculate the hotel score in three different cases.

1. Get the hotel score for a number of hotels where the score is the number of restaurants in a given radius. [Radius.py](https://github.com/Giannoulo/Location-Alocation/blob/master/Radius.py)

2. Get the hotel score for each hotel where the score is the minimum radius in which k restaurants are included. [knn.py](https://github.com/Giannoulo/Location-Alocation/blob/master/Knn.py)

3. Get the score in pairs of hotels where the pair score is the score of the union of the hotels 
without counting the intersection twice. [Pairs.py](https://github.com/Giannoulo/Location-Alocation/blob/master/Pairs.py)
